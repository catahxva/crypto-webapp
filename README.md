# CryptoWave 

CryptoWave is a web app used for searching crypto coins and visualizing data for each crypto coin available. 

## Key Features 

- Usage of a Third Party API: to get all the necessary data, the Coin Ranking API has been used   
- Data Visualization: after selecting a coin you can visualize different stats and metrics like market cap, volume or even see the price progression of the last 24 hours, 7 days or 30 days using a chart
- Searching Functionality: you can search up any crypto coin available and select it to see data
- Comparing Functionality: you can select 2 coints to compare them based on their stats

## Technologies Used 

- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## Architecture 

Implemented the MVC architecture where I have used a model to manage the business logic of the application, multiple views to build up the user interface and a controller to create a bridge in between the model and the views
